# 
# NOTES: 
#   This data set has the single site repression data from Fig. 3 of Brewster
#   et al. 2014 for all operators and data from Garcia and Phillips, 2011. For
#   data from Garcia and Phillips, the number of repressors has been multiplied
#   by two to account for the fact that there are two DNA binding heads of the
#   LacI tetramer. Error bars were not available from the provided data and have
#   been omitted.
#
# COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
#   repressor: Mean number of repressors per cell
#   fold_change: Mean fold-change in gene expression
#   author: Identifier of publication source
#   operator: Identifier of the operator sequence
#   energy: Wild-type repressor DNA binding energy to the operator in kBT.
