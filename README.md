# Reproducible Research Website Template
This repository is a bare-bones template website for publishing of your work as
an interactive website. It's tailored for easy inclusion of data files, plots,
and interactive figures. It is a heavily modified form of the Jekyll template
[Flexible Jekyll](https://artemsheludko.github.io/flexible-jekyll/) by
[`@artemsheludko`](https://github.com/artemsheludko). It is originally published
under the [GNU General Public License
v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) and is distributed here
under the same license terms.

This repository is designed to be hosted as a website on GitHub using the
[GitHub Pages]() hosting service. This service is based on the Ruby framework
[Jekyll]() which is tailored for blog management. I've made several
modifications to the structure to be amenable for scientific publications. 

## How Do I Use This?
Full documentation of how to use this repository as either a standalone website
or as a branch in another repository can be found on the [GitHub Wiki page](https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_website/wiki)
for this repository. 

## Software requirements 
To deploy locally, you must have a [Ruby development environment]() installed as
well as [Jekyll](). You can install Jekyll via 

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Once you have Jekyll installed, you can install of the Ruby requirements for
this website by running the following in the command line from the template directory:

```
bundle install
```

If you are deploying the code from an M1 mac you may need to run the following:

```
bundle update ffi sassc
```

The build and preview the website locally, execute the following:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

This will build the website and serve it up at the address:
[http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000).
